## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

In this challenge is used semantic html5 markup to make the browser understand what was going on and used css grid and flexbox to make the
project as responsive as possible.

```html
  <header>
    <nav class="navigation">
      <a href="#"> <img src="images/logo.svg" alt="Huddle logo"></a>
      <button>Try It Free</button>
    </nav>
    </header>
```
```css
      nav {
    display: flex;
}

nav a {
    width: 6em;
}
```


### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

This challenge started of easy but towards the end i encountered few problems like setting the contact information
icons(location,phone, email) next to the contact information.
